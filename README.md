# Data Analytics Production Line Optimization Model 
Group: Backstreet Bayes 

- Pharma Client that manufactures medical machinery on four independent production
lines
- Each line has multiple unique modules and a single job has to pass through all modules
of the line in chronological order
- There are two buffers between two modules to temporarily store products
- In the beginning of each day, GAM Pharm knows exactly which jobs have to be
processed by which production line until the end of the day
Goal
GAM Pharm wants to reduce the overall processing time of each individual line by finding the
optimal order the given jobs should be processed.

Have a consultant mindset! Beside solving the problem also think of
how to sell/present your ideas, compensate the lack of CS knowledge of
your client, come up with further ideas, insights and hypotheses and
present these in your final presentation.
